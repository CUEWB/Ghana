        <h2 class="section-buzz">Our program is comprised of <span>passionate students</span> committed to improving lives abroad through <span>creative</span> and <span>sustainable</span> engineering <span>solutions</span>.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>The Columbia University chapter of Engineers Without Borders aims to address the problems facing people both locally and overseas by leveraging the skills, talents, and passions of Columbia University students and the sponsorships formed with our organization.  Our members are pursuing many different engineering degrees, but all share the desire to do meaningful work and make a difference.</p>
            <p>The chapter currently consists of three programs in Ghana, <a href="http://uganda.cuewb.org/" target="_blank">Uganda</a>, and <a href="http://morocco.cuewb.org/" target="_blank">Morocco</a>.  The Ghana program, which started in 2004, successfully built a water distribution system and latrines in the farming community of Obadan. It’s now in the process of implementing a similar water distribution system in the nearby village of Amanfrom. Each program draws from the skills of its members to provide technical solutions to worldwide problems.</p>

    <div class="section-info container">
        <h2 class="section-subtitle"><span>Obodan</span> is a rural village in the Eastern Region of Ghana. When we first met with them in 2004, they identified <span>water</span> and <span>sanitation</span> as their largest problems. Open defecation had <span>contaminated</span> the water supply and <span>polluted</span> the air.</h2>
        <h2 class="section-buzz">The <span>Ghana program</span> of Columbia's EWB-USA chapter began working in Obodan in 2004, making it the oldest EWB program in the university. A long line of Columbia students have since worked closely with the village and our hard-working community contact, Samuel Gamson.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>The Ghana program almost immediately began work in Obodan and constructed a Kumasi Ventilated Improved Pit in the village in 2005. After repairing biogas latrines and building a rainwater harvesting system in a nearby village for a few years, the program returned to Obodan. To address the strong release of odors and expensive cleaning procedure of the KVIP, the team built over half a dozen source-separating latrines in Obodan and surrounding villages. This innovative latrine design separates liquid and solid waste, allowing the waste to decompose naturally without odors and allowing villagers to safely clean out the facility on their own. The nitrogen-rich urine that is collected can be used for fertilizer on farms and even aid bacteria in producing biomass to be used for methane, and solid composed waste can be used as a source of renewable energy. The latrines consist of two chambers below ground, where only one is used at a time while the other is covered and allowed to compost.</p>
            <p>The Ghana program is currently monitoring the latrines in Obodan and nearby villages to ensure that they are being properly operated and maintained.</p>

    <h1 class="section-title">Amanfrom Water Project</h1>
    <div class="section-info container">
        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Amanfrom is a rural village of 2000 subsistence <span>farmers</span> in the eastern region of Ghana. When we began working with them in 2015, they <span>lacked clean year-round water</span> sources. Women and children had to walk <span>long distances</span> to collect water.</h2>
        <h2 class="section-buzz">
            The <span>water distribution system</span> we are currently building in Amanfrom will create a <span>gravity-fed</span> water distribution system that will bring water to 6-8 <span>standpipes</span> in locations chosen by the Amanfrom Water Committee.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>In 2014, the village of Amanfrom contacted us asking for a water distribution system similar to our past project in Obodan. Amanfrom relied exclusively on seasonal surface water and shallow groundwater from streams, springs and hand-dug wells, all of which failed to meet WHO standards. To address this issue, we drilled and constructed two new wells within the community during our first implementation trip in August 2016. These two new reliable sources of water have greatly increased the water capacity of the community. Our chapter seeks to continue implementation and use these two wells in a gravity-fed water distribution system to bring water to six additional points in the village. Once the water system is firmly in place, the local government will begin collecting small fees for water, which will enable them to save funds for maintenance, repairs and future development projects.</p>
            <p>Our team is also preparing an in-depth education effort in order to teach water, sanitation, and hygiene lessons to the villagers in Amanfrom. We will also be conducting water quality tests to ensure that the water meets WHO standards, and we will also monitor the community’s capacity to independently operate and  manage the new water distribution system.</p>

    <h1 class="section-title">What's Next?</h1>
    <div class="section-info container">
        <h2 class="section-buzz">We are currently looking at a few <span>villages</span> in the area around Obodan that have <span>shown need</span> and expressed a strong <span>willingness to work</span> for their <span>development</span>.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>In the past year, we have researched more types of water systems and prepared plans for our next project, which will likely became the focus of our work in the coming year once we are certain that the infrastructure in Obodan will be sustained.</p>
            <p>Amanfrom is a large village of almost 2,000 people that relies principally on a pool of water with visible contamination for water. The source becomes dry for many months during the dry season, and the village leaders have stated that the people in the village cannot afford bottled water and continue to drink from the pond. A shallow hand-dug well is not operational, and many people resort to walking over a large hill to the next village for water. The villagers in Amanfrom have requested a water system similar to the one in Obodan.</p>
            <p>Fahiako is a heavily forested village of roughly 500 people spread over a large area, where the major water sources are two pools. The water is also visibly contaminated and illnesses are widespread. The villagers have requested a health clinic, as the government is willing to provide the staff and the nearest clinic is 25-30 minutes away by taxi, although the village is too remote for taxis to reach and they must be called, though Fahiako does not have electricity nor cell phone service. Work in Fahiako would likely entail a water system followed by a health clinic, as clean water would be necessary to run a health clinic.</p>
            <p>Akwakopom is a village of approximately 750 people – only slightly smaller than Obodan. Akwakopom's pump has been broken for some time now, and the villagers rely on a small contaminated stream of water. The villagers have first and foremost requested a water system.</p>
