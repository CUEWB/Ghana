        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>The Columbia University chapter of Engineers Without Borders aims to address the problems facing people both locally and overseas by leveraging the skills, talents, and passions of Columbia University students and the sponsorships formed with our organization.  Our members come from many different arts, sciences, and engineering backgrounds, but share the desire to do meaningful work and make a difference.</p>
            <p>The chapter currently consists of three programs in Ghana, Uganda, and Morocco.  The <a href="http://cuewb.org/ghana.html" target="_blank">Ghana program</a>, which started in 2004, used to work in the semi-urban town of Sakyikrom but now focuses on water management in the farming community of Obodan.  In 2008, the <a href="http://cuewb.org/uganda.html" target="_blank">Uganda program</a> was established to install a Multi-Function Energy Platform in the Soroti region.  The Morocco program, which began in 2011, finished building a <a href="#bridge">bridge</a> in the rural community of Ait Bayoud in June 2013 and is now planning a future <a href="#water">water project</a> in the nearby community of Izgouaren.  Each project draws from the skills of its members to provide technical solutions to worldwide problems.</p>

        <h2 class="section-subtitle"><span>Obodan</span> is a rural village in the Eastern Region of Ghana. When we first met with them in 2004, they identified <span>water</span> and <span>sanitation</span> as their largest problems. Open defecation had <span>contaminated</span> the water supply and <span>polluted</span> the air.</h2>
        <h2 class="section-buzz">The <span>Ghana program</span> of Columbia's EWB-USA chapter began working in Obodan in 2004, making it the oldest EWB program in the university. A long line of Columbia students have since worked closely with the village and our hard-working community contact, Samuel Gamson.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>The Ghana program almost immediately began work in Obodan and constructed a Kumasi Ventilated Improved Pit in the village in 2005. After repairing biogas latrines and building a rainwater harvesting system in a nearby village for a few years, the program returned to Obodan. To address the strong release of odors and expensive cleaning procedure of the KVIP, the team built over half a dozen source-separating latrines in Obodan and surrounding villages. This innovative latrine design separates liquid and solid waste, allowing the waste to decompose naturally without odors and allowing villagers to safely clean out the facility on their own. The nitrogen-rich urine that is collected can be used for fertilizer on farms and even aid bacteria in producing biomass to be used for methane, and solid composed waste can be used as a source of renewable energy. The latrines consist of two chambers below ground, where only one is used at a time while the other is covered and allowed to compost.</p>
            <p>The Ghana program is currently monitoring the latrines in Obodan and nearby villages to ensure that they are being properly operated and maintained.</p>

        <h2 class="section-subtitle"><span>Distant sources</span> of water posed <span>dangers</span> to the children fetching water from the busy road in Obodan. <span>Long lines</span> took time away from schooling and other daily work, and <span>contamination</span> in the water led to many <span>sicknesses</span>.</h2>
        <h2 class="section-buzz">Once the <span>design</span> and <span>construction</span> of latrines neared <span>completion</span>, the <span>water project</span> became a <span>major focus</span> of the Ghana program's work beginning around 2011.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>Assessment teams surveyed the land for data on elevation, conducted many water quality tests around the year, met with local contractors and technicians, performed slug tests, and helped the community determine the best way to collect money for when the system needed maintenance.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2013, the Ghana program constructed the water distribution system. The system consists of an electric-powered submersible pump, two 10,000 liter storage tanks placed on top of the hill in Obodan, and an extensive framework of pipes to deliver water by gravity to spigots conveniently located around the village. The water, pumped directly from the water table, avoids almost all of the contaminants that pollute surface water or shallow groundwater, and is safe to drink by Ghanaian and WHO standards. The location of the spigots eliminates the need for villagers to cross any road, and drainage ensures that any water is accidentally spilled near the spigots does not flood and contribute to erosion. The large storage capacity ensures that in case of a power outage, there will be enough water to last for 3-5 days, and a manual pump serves as an additional water supply.</p>

    <h1 class="section-title">What's Next?</h1>
    <div class="section-info container">
        <h2 class="section-buzz">We are currently looking at a few <span>villages</span> in the area around Obodan that have <span>shown need</span> and expressed a strong <span>willingness to work</span> for their <span>development</span>.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>In the past year, we have researched more types of water systems and prepared plans for our next project, which will likely became the focus of our work in the coming year once we are certain that the infrastructure in Obodan will be sustained.</p>
            <p>Amanfrom is a large village of almost 2,000 people that relies principally on a pool of water with visible contamination for water. The source becomes dry for many months during the dry season, and the village leaders have stated that the people in the village cannot afford bottled water and continue to drink from the pond. A shallow hand-dug well is not operational, and many people resort to walking over a large hill to the next village for water. The villagers in Amanfrom have requested a water system similar to the one in Obodan.</p>
            <p>Fahiako is a heavily forested village of roughly 500 people spread over a large area, where the major water sources are two pools. The water is also visibly contaminated and illnesses are widespread. The villagers have requested a health clinic, as the government is willing to provide the staff and the nearest clinic is 25-30 minutes away by taxi, although the village is too remote for taxis to reach and they must be called, though Fahiako does not have electricity nor cell phone service. Work in Fahiako would likely entail a water system followed by a health clinic, as clean water would be necessary to run a health clinic.</p>
            <p>Akwakopom is a village of approximately 750 people â€“ only slightly smaller than Obodan. Akwakopom's pump has been broken for some time now, and the villagers rely on a small contaminated stream of water. The villagers have first and foremost requested a water system.</p>
