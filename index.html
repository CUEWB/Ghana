            <p>The Columbia University chapter of Engineers Without Borders aims to address the problems facing people both locally and overseas by leveraging the skills, talents, and passions of Columbia University students and the sponsorships formed with our organization.  Our members are pursuing many different engineering degrees, but all share the desire to do meaningful work and make a difference.</p>
            <p>The chapter currently consists of three programs in Ghana, <a href="http://uganda.cuewb.org/" target="_blank">Uganda</a>, and <a href="http://morocco.cuewb.org/" target="_blank">Morocco</a>.  The Ghana program, which started in 2004, successfully built a water distribution system and latrines in the farming community of Obadan. It’s now in the process of implementing a similar water distribution system in the nearby village of Amanfrom. Each program draws from the skills of its members to provide technical solutions to worldwide problems.</p>

        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Amanfrom is a rural village of 2000 subsistence <span>farmers</span> in the eastern region of Ghana. When we began working with them in 2015, they <span>lacked clean year-round water</span> sources. Women and children had to walk <span>long distances</span> to collect water.</h2>
        <h2 class="section-buzz">
            The <span>water distribution system</span> we are currently building in Amanfrom will create a <span>gravity-fed</span> water distribution system that will bring water to 6-8 <span>standpipes</span> in locations chosen by the Amanfrom Water Committee.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>In 2014, the village of Amanfrom contacted us asking for a water distribution system similar to our past project in Obodan. Amanfrom relied exclusively on seasonal surface water and shallow groundwater from streams, springs and hand-dug wells, all of which failed to meet WHO standards. To address this issue, we drilled and constructed two new wells within the community during our first implementation trip in August 2016. These two new reliable sources of water have greatly increased the water capacity of the community. Our chapter seeks to continue implementation and use these two wells in a gravity-fed water distribution system to bring water to six additional points in the village. Once the water system is firmly in place, the local government will begin collecting small fees for water, which will enable them to save funds for maintenance, repairs and future development projects.</p>
            <p>Our team is also preparing an in-depth education effort in order to teach water, sanitation, and hygiene lessons to the villagers in Amanfrom. We will also be conducting water quality tests to ensure that the water meets WHO standards, and we will also monitor the community’s capacity to independently operate and  manage the new water distribution system.</p>

    <div class="section-info container">
        <h2 class="section-subtitle">When we first met with the rural village of Obodan in 2004, they identified <span>water</span> and <span>sanitation</span> as their largest problems. Open defecation had <span>contaminated</span> the water supply, which forced children to take time away from schooling to fetch waters from <span>distant sources</span> of water.</h2>
        <h2 class="section-buzz">
            The Ghana program of Columbia’s EWB-USA chapter began working in Obodan in 2004, making it the <span>oldest EWB program</span> in the university. Many Columbia students have since <span>worked closely</span> with the village and our hard-working community contact, Samuel Gamson.</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
            <p>The Ghana program almost immediately began work in Obodan and constructed a Kumasi Ventilated Improved Pit in the village in 2005. After repairing biogas latrines and building a rainwater harvesting system in a nearby village for a few years, the program returned to Obodan. Ghana program members have overseen the successful installation of nine latrines in Obodan and surrounding villages.</p>
            <p>Once the design and construction of latrines neared completion, the water project became a major focus of the Ghana program's work beginning around 2011. Assessment teams surveyed the land for data on elevation, conducted many water quality tests around the year, met with local contractors and technicians, and helped the community determine the best way to collect money for when the system needed maintenance. In the summer of 2013, the Ghana program constructed the water distribution system. The system consists of an electric-powered submersible pump, two 10,000 liter storage tanks placed on top of the hill in Obodan, and an extensive framework of pipes to deliver water by gravity to spigots conveniently located around the village. The water, pumped directly from the water table, avoids almost all of the contaminants that pollute surface water or shallow groundwater, and is safe to drink by Ghanaian and WHO standards. The location of the spigots eliminates the need for villagers to cross any road, and drainage ensures that any water is accidentally spilled near the spigots does not flood and contribute to erosion.</p>
            <p>As of 2016, the water distribution system is financially sustainable and functioning independently, while the latrines are community owned and operated. The money generated from collecting fees at the water spigots have generated revenue for other community projects in Obodan.</p>
